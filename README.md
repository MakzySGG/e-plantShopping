# Final Project: Paradise Nursery Shopping Cart Application

This project is a React-based shopping cart application for an online plant shop called Paradise Nursery.

The application allows users to browse a variety of house plants, view details such as images, names, descriptions, and prices, and add plants to a shopping cart. Users can increase or decrease quantities, remove items from the cart, and view the total cost dynamically.

This project was built using React, Redux Toolkit, and Vite as part of the e-plantShopping application.
